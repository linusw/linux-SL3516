          Manual setting of AHB clock, must match the jumper setting on
          the board, or the system time won't be correctly calculated.
          Notice that even when AUTO_SYS_CLK is ON, this value is still
          required for adjusting minor time offsets. However, the influence
          should be within micro-second to nano-second scale.

           There is only one FIQ supported in the Kernel, select this option if
           you want to support multiple FIQs on the system. Please ensure your
           FIQ handler has super low latency to the system. The default max FIQ
           handlers is 2, it is configurable in mach-GM/include/mach/mfiq.h.
